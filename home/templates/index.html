        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <p>Our family has been growing horseradish for several years in Létavértes, the homeland of Hungarian
                horseradish and since 2012, we have been processing the excellent quality roots on a small scale.
                Hungarian horseradish is a hungaricum, which has been declared and protected by the European Commission
                since 2004.
            </p>
            <p>Our products do not contain preservatives or other artificial additives. Our horseradish is also
                available in a sugar-free version.

                highest practical level of handicraft products!

            <h2>About the horseradish</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <p>Initially, horseradish was not even considered an aromatic herb, it was mainly used only in folk
                medicine. It is high in sodium, calcium, magnesium and vitamin C and is also known, for its preventive
                effects on health. It is excellent for stomach aches, helps digestion and brings appetite. More and more
                people believe that horseradish also has antiviral and bactericidal effects.</p>
            <p>It is a bad habit, that grated horseradish is usually consumed only during Easter in just few European
                countries. Horseradish can serve our body particularly well during vitamin-deficient months of winter
                and spring, and it harmonizes perfectly with almost any meat dish. </p>
            <p>Instead of medications, use a natural immune booster especially if it is within reach and also
                delicious!</p>
